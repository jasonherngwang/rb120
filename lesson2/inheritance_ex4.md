What is the method lookup path and how is it important?

The order in which classes and modules are traversed during a method invocation, to find the method that was invoked. The first occurrence found is executed.

Invoke `::ancestors` on the class to display this.

In order from first to last:

1. The object’s own class
2. Mixins included in the object’s class
    - Order: Looks at mixins from last included to first included.
3. Any superclass
4. Mixins included in the superclass
    - Order: Looks at mixins from last included to first included.
5. `Object` class
6. `Kernel` module
7. `BasicObject` class

If the method is not found, the `NoMethodError` error will be thrown.
