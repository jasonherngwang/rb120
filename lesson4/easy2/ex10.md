## What are the benefits of OOP?

OOP is a programming paradigm used to organize code into smaller containers that interact with each other. This improves flexibility and reuse. Each piece of code protects its data and methods, exposing only what is needed; this is the concept of encapsulation. OOP reduces dependencies and maintenance requirements because changes can be made to sections of the code or individual classes without disrupting the entire program. The program becomes more manageable. OOP enables programmers to group code into classes and modules and think at a higher level of abstraction. The behaviors and attributes of classes and modules can be modeled after real-world nouns and verbs, which makes it easier to conceptualize.
